Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  Driverpass was a system that we created thats main goal was students succesfully passing their driving exams. The client was Driverpass and they wanted us to design a system where the students could find and use DMV endorsed information that would help them succeed. The system also has a reservation system that allows students the power to schedule road lessons and pay online. The system was also designed so instructors can leave feedback and allow the students to read it.

What did you do particularly well?
  Personally I believe that I ensured that all of the clients needs were met and noted. There needs to be a level of thoroughness and spotlessness.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would try to focus on more data gathering from online resources.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I analyzed the user's input to understand their requirements and then incorporated those needs into the system design, ensuring it aligns with the user's goals and preferences. Considering the user's needs is vital in design as it enhances user satisfaction, usability, and the overall success of the system by addressing the end-users' expectations and delivering a product that meets their demands effectively.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  Designing software involves a systematic process that begins with requirements gathering and system architecture design, encompassing principles like modularity, scalability, and security. Continuous iteration, feedback incorporation, and staying abreast of evolving technologies and user-centered design are essential strategies for future software design.
